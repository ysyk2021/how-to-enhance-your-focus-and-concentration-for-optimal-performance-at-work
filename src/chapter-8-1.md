While this can be a powerful tool for productivity, it can also lead to information overload and distract us from our work. Here's why managing digital devices and information overload is important in the workplace:

## Minimizing Distractions

Digital devices, such as smartphones and computers, can be major distractions in the workplace. By managing these devices and minimizing their impact on our workday, we can stay focused and productive.

## Reducing Stress

Feeling overwhelmed by information or constantly checking digital devices can be stressful. By managing digital devices and information overload, we can reduce stress levels and improve our overall well-being.
